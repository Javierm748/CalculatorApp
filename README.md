# Overview

 I decided to build a simple command-line calculator. This project was a hands-on way to explore key features of the language like object-oriented programming, the Standard Template Library (STL), and file handling. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and keeps a history of calculations, which you can save to or load from a file.

My main goal was to deepen my understanding of C++ syntax and programming concepts. Working on this calculator allowed me to get practical experience with classes, functions, exception handling, and using STL containers like vector. It was a fun and educational way to dive deeper into the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code
Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Programming Language: C++11
Libraries Used:
<iostream> for input and output streams
<vector> from the STL for managing the calculation history
<string> and <sstream> for string manipulations
<fstream> for file input/output operations
<stdexcept> for exception handling

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add Advanced Operations: I'd like to implement functions like exponentiation, square roots, and trigonometric calculations
- Enhance Input Validation: Improving how the program handles invalid inputs to prevent crashes
- Develop a GUI: Creating a graphical user interface to make the calculator more user-friendly
